"""Bootstrap for the Altium MCP extension.

Two roles in one file:

  python start_server.py           the LAUNCHER Claude Desktop runs. Makes
                                   sure a ready venv exists, then execs
                                   server/main.py inside it.
  python start_server.py --build   the BUILDER. Creates the venv and installs
                                   the pinned requirements, then exits.

The builder is a separate, DETACHED process on purpose. Claude Desktop gives
a server about 60 s to answer `initialize` and then kills it, and it also
restarts servers freely (extension install, app update, new session). A pip
install that runs inside the launcher dies with it, leaving a half-built venv
and a lock nobody will release. A detached builder finishes regardless, so a
restarted launcher finds the venv ready or a build genuinely in progress.

# resolved its transitive dependencies to current releases and the venv ended
# up on starlette 1.6.0 against the 0.46.1 that mcp 1.5.0 was released with -
# a major version apart. That went unnoticed while the server only spoke stdio,
# because none of it was on the path; it matters now that the server also
# serves SSE, which is starlette and uvicorn end to end. Versions below are
# requirements.txt's, i.e. the set upstream exported and tested together.
